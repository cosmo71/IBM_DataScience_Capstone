SpaceX Rocket Flacon 9 landing prediction

In this capstone project, we aim to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX markets Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars, significantly lower than other providers who charge north of 165 million dollars. The substantial savings are primarily due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. By predicting the likelihood of a first stage landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This information is valuable for SpaceX competitors as well as buyers for rocket launch contracts.
